# Pooling strategies for detecting Covid in University of Bristol students

The University of Bristol UoB plans to commence the 2020 academic year with a strategy of placing students in living circles, to minimise the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the student body. To monitor outbreaks it would be costly to simply test everybody on a regular basis, and so whether pooling samples could effectively reduce costs and still adequately detect outbreaks is an open question.

## To run

Obtain xlsx file containing living circle counts for halls of residence, place in `docs`, then run

```
snakemake
```

The simulations take about 1 hour on 16 cores.
